## Desing

- I have chosen these colours because hero picture is stands out. Dominant colours brown, green and blue. I've used different shades of same colours (green, dark-brown,blue, bisque, antiquewhite) to keep the same themes. That help me to keep colour contrast and avoid colours blending.

### Hero Image

Hero images wasused from https://www.istockphoto.com website. I found this image can helpful for user to have idea what this martial art style about and it is in outdoors motivating to exercise in nature.

## Font  

- For text fonts styling I've use Poppins font style.

Light 300 font from link google fonts website. Itâ€™s creating classic appearance together with colours look brigth.
